# PredictFutureSales
This challenge serves as final project for the "How to win a data science competition" Coursera course.

Since the data is public, I took the opportunity to play around with these transaction data, provide insights and ultimately build a predictive model.

The dataset constists of daily sales data and was provided by Russian software firms - 1C Company.

The goal of this project is to ***predict*** total sales for each (store, product) pair 1-month ahead.

# File Descriptions
- ***sales_train.csv*** - the training set. Daily historical data from January 2013 to October 2015.
- ***test.csv*** - the test set. You need to forecast the sales for these shops and products for November 2015.
